Usage: i2c speed [STD|FAST|FAST+|HIGH]                                                        - change bus speed
       i2c read <channel> <read_slave_addr> count                                             - read test
       i2c write <channel> <write_slave_addr> data0 data1 ..                                  - write test
       i2c <channel> [addr <write_slave_addr> data0 data1 ..] [addr <read_slave_addr> count]  - read after write test
