!!!Please make sure uart channel is configured. !!!
Usage: uart config {-[ch|br|db|pb|sb|fc] value}
          -ch: channel number (DO NOT set to the current using UART channel)
          -rate: baudrate
          -data: number of data bits
               0: 5 bits per data
               1: 6 bits per data
               2: 7 bits per data
               3: 8 bits per data
          -parity: parity bit check
               0: no parity bit
               1: even parity bit
               2: odd parity bit
          -stop: number of stop bits
               0: 1 stop bit
               1: 1.5 stop bits
               2: 2 stop bits
          -flow: flow control
               0: no flow control
               1: hardware flow control
               2: software flow control
       uart send: create a send task on given channel
       uart recv: create a receive task on given channel
       uart looptest [channel]: self-loop UART test
Note: The self-loop test is used to verify the UART transfer within the same UART channel. Before doing the test,
      please link the UART Tx and Rx pins together, and carefully specify and configurate the UART channel. The
      self-loop test will create a send task and a receive task on the given channel. Then, do the comparion to
      check if the recived data is the same as the sent test pattern (0x5a).
