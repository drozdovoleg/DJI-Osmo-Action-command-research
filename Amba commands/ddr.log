Usage: ddr dump [all|timing]
       ddr phase <edge0> <edge1>
       ddr shmoo [sync|read|write] [+|-] [time(ms)]
          How to run DDR quick shmoo :
           - 1. Type "sync + 1000" : Increase sync value and wait 1000ms, shmoo the sync byte one by one until system hang, ex: 20->00->01->02
           - 2. Type "sync - 1000" : Decrease sync value and wait 1000ms, shmoo the sync byte one by one until system hang, ex: 20->21->22->23
           - 3. Repeat the above procedures on Read and Write phase.
           - 4. Collect the workable ranges of sync, read and write byte.
       ddr set [sync|read|write] <value>
